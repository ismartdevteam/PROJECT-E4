URLs
===============================

This python file contains the URL redirection definitions for the application "Login".
This URL file is the first to be accessed by the user when the user requests the IP address
and the port number (localhost:8000). We can tell Django the path of the URL of the login application
by specifying this information in the settings.py file.
