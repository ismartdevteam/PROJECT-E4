#Introduction
Learning management System (LMS) is a software application for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting and delivery of educational courses. It helps the instructor deliver course material to the students, administer tests and other assignments, track student progress, and manage record-keeping. Proposed LMS in this project is mainly focused on online tests delivery but support a range of other uses; it will act as a platform for fully online exercises evaluation system.
This project is expected to deliver a flexible, easy to use and secure online portal that will replace WIMS and PL learning management systems which are not fulfilling the current online student evaluation requirements of the university.
The new LMS will facilitate professors with dynamic graphical reports of student evaluation in form of charts, interactive illustrations and will allow students to attempt exercises through a user friendly platform and communicate with professors by easy to use messaging system which are lacking in the currently available systems.
